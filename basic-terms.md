# Basic Terms

**Basic terms - 1. 10k project**&#x20;

A 10k project is an NFT collection consisting of approximately 10,000 avatars. This type of NFT was arguably pioneered by the CryptoPunks collection in 2017 with many new ones following since then. They don’t all have exactly 10,000 avatars though, but the term is used to refer to this type of collection rather than the exact number of avatars.



**Airdrop**&#x20;

When you receive an ‘airdrop’, you automatically get a certain amount of a specific cryptocurrency or a new NFT dropped into your wallet for free. It’s long been a common practice in the general crypto space but has also become a popular way for NFT projects to reward their early adopters with new artworks, for instance.



**Apeing (into something)**&#x20;

Not affiliated with the Bored Ape Yacht Club or any of the other ape-themed 10k projects, to ‘ape into’ something means buying something in an irresponsible manner, out of FOMO, with too much money relative to your account size, and/or without having done your proper due diligence.



**Avatar project**&#x20;

An avatar project is basically the same as a 10k project, i.e., a collection of a few thousand NFT ‘avatars’ like the CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Cool Cats, Gutter Cat Gang, etc.



**Burn**&#x20;

To burn an NFT essentially means to destroy it. If only 5,000 NFTs are sold in a collection that was intended to consist of 10,000, for instance, the team may decide to ‘burn’ the remaining 5,000. Other projects let their owners ‘burn’ two NFTs to receive a new and more rare one.



**DAO**&#x20;

DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. When you own an NFT from a project like Head DAO, you and all the other owners have voting rights and control over the future actions and overall direction of the project. Many NFT projects are setting up similar structures to become more community-driven and secure ongoing support.



**Diamond hands**&#x20;

‘Diamond hands’ is one of the most popular slang terms in the world of crypto and NFTs. It’s become its own meme, its own emoji, and even the theme of whole NFT projects. A person with diamond hands is a person who holds on to an asset through price volatility, negative news, poor market sentiment, and whatever kind of FUD (another abbreviation we’ll cover below) you’ll encounter in this space.



**Paper hands**&#x20;

‘Paper hands’ is basically the opposite of ‘diamond hands’ and is another term that isn’t NFT-specific but often used in the space. It refers to someone who sells something, e.g., an NFT or a cryptocurrency, at what is perceived by others as too low of a price.



**Floor**&#x20;

The ‘floor’ or ‘floor price’ of a project is simply the lowest price at which you can buy an NFT from that project on the secondary market. It’s the most popular metric for tracking a project’s performance over time and its relative success compared to others.



**FUD**

‘FUD’ stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. The term is used in crypto and NFTs alike to describe negative news stories, tweets, Discord messages, etc., that are either inaccurate or completely false. You’ll often see people point to FUD as the reason behind large price drops in cryptocurrencies or NFTs.



**Gas**&#x20;

The price for making a transaction on a blockchain is called ‘gas’. When buying NFTs on a blockchain like Solana, gas is negligible. On Ethereum, however, a $50 gas fee is about the lowest you can hope for, and it all depends on the activity on the network. Low activity, low fees. High activity, high fees. Which leads me to the next term you need to know…



**Gas war**&#x20;

Oh, the dreaded gas wars! These are a common occurrence on Ethereum and somewhat of a rite of passage for newcomers. When a popular NFT collection launches, with 100,000 people fighting for 10,000 NFTs, you need to increase your gas fee and outbid the others’ for your transaction to go through. This is what’s known as a gas war.



**Generative art**&#x20;

Generative art deserves a lot more attention than I’m able to give it here and there’s plenty of good material available on the topic. It’s arguably one of the key innovations in the world of digital art and collectibles in recent years, used to create all the major collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club, Cool Cats, Sup Ducks, Pudgy Penguins, etc.

In short, all the NFTs in each of these collections have certain traits in common: Clothes, skin or fur color, eye type, headwear, background color, etc. With 20 different types of clothes, 20 different eye types, 20 different background colors, etc., it’s possible to mix and match these traits to create a collection of 10,000 NFTs that are all unique. While the initial traits are hand-made, each NFT is automatically created by a computer with a random combination of all the available traits. This is the part of the process that’s described as ‘generative’.



**Metadata**&#x20;

I’ll go with the non-technical and very simplified explanation here: The metadata of an NFT is essentially all the necessary and unique data making that NFT exactly what it is. Perhaps most interestingly, the metadata defines how a piece of art or a collectible looks. That’s why you’ll sometimes have to refresh the metadata on OpenSea before you can see how your newly minted NFT looks.



**Minting**&#x20;

When you’re buying a completely new NFT from the creator, you’re ‘minting’ it. It’s basically the process of creating that NFT on the blockchain.



**MM**&#x20;

MM is shorthand for MetaMask, the most popular NFT wallet in the Ethereum ecosystem.



**OS**

OS is shorthand for OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace on Ethereum.



**Reveal**&#x20;

The word here is pretty self-explanatory, but its meaning in an NFT context may not be. For new generative projects, the artwork won’t actually be created until the NFT is minted, and you won’t know exactly what you get until after you buy it. In other words, the art only reveals itself after it’s purchased. It’s up to the creators behind the collection whether the reveal happens immediately, when the collection sells out, or with a delay of 24 or 48 hours for instance.



**Rugpull/RUG**

A ‘rugpull’ is something I hope you’ll never experience! It’s essentially a scam where the people behind a seemingly legit project disappear with all the money immediately after launch. You might get an actual NFT in return for what you paid, but it’s most likely worthless and not even tradeable on a secondary marketplace.



**Snapshot**&#x20;

In relation to the airdrops mentioned above, a team will often take a snapshot at a certain point in time to determine who’s eligible. For instance, everyone who held NFT X in their wallet at the time of the snapshot on November 11, 4pm UTC, will get a free airdrop of NFT Y next week.



**(Floor) Sweep**

&#x20;‘Sweeping’ is another commonly uttered term because of people’s interest in a project’s ‘floor’. To ‘sweep the floor’ means to buy up a large number of the cheapest NFTs in a collection on the secondary market. Teams sometimes do this, or are asked by the community to do this, for their own projects. Other times it may be done by a single individual, referred to as a ‘whale’.



**Whale**

&#x20;A ‘whale’ is basically someone with a lot of money, either available to invest or already invested in a high-value NFT project. Thus, someone with 1,000 ETH in their account would be considered a whale, just like someone with 200 Bored Apes would. Whales are important because of their power to move markets, either upward by buying a lot from a given collection or downward by selling.
