**What is OpenSea?**

&#x20;OpenSea is one of the most popular peer-to-peer NFT marketplaces to buy, sell, and create NFTs on web3. Founded in 2017, OpenSea has earned their spot as the busiest NFT marketplace with a trading volume over $6.5 billion.

Unlike some of the other NFT marketplaces, OpenSea does not focus on one specific niche within the NFT community. Instead, OpenSea offers a marketplace where both creators and collectors can come to buy, sell, and create all kinds of NFTs.



**Setting up your OpenSea account**

&#x20;If this is your first time visiting the OpenSea NFT marketplace and you plan on transacting, then you will need to create your account first. Here is how you create your account on OpenSea: Go to the Connect Wallet tab, found in the Menu section and choose which type of wallet you are connecting to OpenSea. This will prompt you to digitally sign for approval, confirming that you would like to connect your wallet to the OpenSea marketplace.

Once your wallet is connected to OpenSea, you can go to your Profile and update your information in Settings, such as Username, Bio, Email Address, Social Links, and Images. From there, you are all set to go. Generally, after you have set up your OpenSea account you will login by digitally signing, using your wallet.



**Selling an NFT on OpenSea**&#x20;

Selling your NFT should not be a difficult task. That’s why the OpenSea team made their process of selling NFTs very user-friendly. So, how do you sell an NFT on OpenSea? To sell an NFT on OpenSea go to Menu, then select Account, and finally go to your Profile where you can choose which of your NFTs you want to sell. Choose your NFT and then tap Sell. This will give you the ability to set the price of your NFT and schedule your listing.

When you go to sell an NFT on OpenSea, you may notice that there are four different types of listing options available for you to choose from:

Fixed price (Buy Now) The fixed price listing option will put your NFT on sale for a Buy Now price. This listing strategy is straightforward and good if you have a set price for the NFT you're selling.

Dutch auction (Begins high, ends low) When you list your NFT using the dutch auction strategy, you are simply setting a starting price, ending price, and the duration of the auction. As time progresses, the original price decreases until reaching the set floor price.

Auction (Starting price, or reserve price) The Auction listing option is your standard English auction. You simply list your NFT for a minimum price and then you allow buyers to bid on it. You also have the ability to set a reserve price and you can accept any offer you would like.

Bundle (list multiple NFTs as one bundle) Bundling your NFTs is a great choice if you are looking to sell more than one NFT to the same buyer. When you bundle multiple NFTs, only one transaction is required as opposed to multiple, meaning you the buyer saves on having to pay numerous gas fees.

As far as fees are concerned, OpenSea has made it very simple for users. They take 2.5 percent of every transaction that occurs. Nothing else. Other than that you can create NFTs for free at any time. Also, as the original creator you can set a royalty of up to 10 percent. Meaning, you can earn revenue every single time your NFT sells on the marketplace.



**Buying an NFT on OpenSea**

&#x20;Considering NFTs have attracted a large crowd of collectors and investors alike, it’s no wonder why OpenSea decided to offer an assortment of NFTs as opposed to one single niche of collectible assets. If you are an NFT collector/investor like myself, then you’ve likely asked, how do you buy an NFT on OpenSea?

Purchasing an NFT on OpenSea is as simple as signing into your Opensea account, and either using the Explore tab, or the Search function to browse for an NFT that sparks your interest. Once you have found an NFT that you would like to buy, select it, then choose Buy Now or Make Offer, if you would like to bid on an item. Finally, you will need to sign for the transaction.

If you put an offer in, you will have to wait until the buyer either accepts or rejects your offer. If you end up needing to cancel your offer, you will need to pay a gas fee in order to cancel your bid. If you choose Buy Now however, then the transaction will occur immediately after your digital signature, and the asset will be transferred to your wallet generally within a few minutes.

Want to verify that you received your NFT? Simply go to the OpenSea Menu, then go to Account, Profile, and then make sure you are viewing the Collected tab. This is where you can find all your NFTs that you have collected on your specific wallet address.

Note that your newly purchased NFT make take a moment to populate in your OpenSea account. If you want to verify your transaction on the blockchain, you can do that using Etherscan.io.

Etherscan allows you to search the blockchain for addresses, transactions, tokens, prices, and anything else taking place on the Ethereum blockchain.
