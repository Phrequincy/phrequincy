**WHAT IS METAMASK?**&#x20;

MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

&#x20;It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.



**HOW TO MAKE A METAMASK WALLET ?**

To make a MetaMask wallet, you need to add the MetaMask extension to Chrome.

Then, you’ll be able to create a wallet by following the on-screen instructions.

The wallet creation process contains 3 steps.

This includes creating a password, saving your backup phrase, and confirming your backup phrase.

Storing your backup phrase is the most important step.

This is because you need it to import your MetaMask wallet.

It’s important that you store your backup phrase in a safe place.

Anyone with your backup phrase will be able to steal your Ethereum.

After you’ve stored your backup phrase, you need to verify it to create your wallet.



**Here is how to make a MetaMask wallet:**

**1.**&#x20;

Add MetaMask to Chrome

Before you can create a MetaMask wallet, you need to add the MetaMask extension to Chrome.&#x20;

If you’re using a mobile device, you need to download the MetaMask app on the App Store or Google Play Store. In this guide, we’ll create a MetaMask wallet on Chrome instead.

&#x20;To begin with, you need to install Chrome on your PC if you haven’t already. Next, search for “MetaMask” on Google and click on the first search result that says, “MetaMask”.&#x20;

Then, click on “Download” on the MetaMask website.&#x20;
