# Stack

**General**

Whitelist botting at this very moment is very profitable and it also carries more advantages:

You can get multiple whitelists for most projects and securing a big bag of ETH

There is really 0 risk when it comes to whitelists. If the project does well during pre-sale, you can just mint and insta flip it for free $.

You can also sell your whitelists and earn 0 risk income.\


**Set Up**



Buy some discord burner accounts either from our provider or from othersThere is really 0 risk when it comes to whitelists. If the project does well during pre-sale, you can just mint and insta flip it for free $.

First off we need to download our main tool. Which is called STACK ([https://stackbrowser.com/](https://stackbrowser.com)) and install it.

Open stack and start creating spaces. I suggest to name them with the number of discord accounts in them.

Now let's go back to your main account and create a server for your burners.

I suggest you to have 3 channels in the server:

Invites (you will use this channel to seemlessly invite your burners) wins (you will use this channel to keep track of your whiteLists) burner-list (you will use this channel to keep track of your burners

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

Start inviting your burners into the server. Once you are done with all of the accounts, you should make am Excel file to keep track of your tokens.



**Excel Set-up should be like this:**

A) First row, make sure to have discord&#x20;

B) Second row, make sure to assert 1 wallet adress to each one.

This will help u assign wallets to discord # and keep track of them.

create new google user and add entirely new metamask.

**s**tart creating 1 wallet for each discord you have (there is no limit)

* finish the set-up and you will never-ever in your life miss out on another whitelist. GL.
