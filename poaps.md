# POAPs

**What is POAP?**&#x20;

POAP ( Proof of Attendance Protocol) is a new way of keeping a reliable record of life experiences. Each time they take part in an event, POAP collectors get a unique digital collectible that is supported by a cryptographic record. These digital collectibles are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and open a whole new world of possibilities.

**How to claim POAP?**&#x20;

When you attend a POAP-sponsored event, the organizer will distribute claim codes in the form of QR codes or URLs. Scan the QR code or enter the URL in your browser to claim the POAP using your Ethereum address, or enter your email to reserve the POAP so you can claim it at a later time.

**Can you sell your POAP?**&#x20;

Although it is not recommended to sell your life's bookmarks, you can do so by using epor on xDai and OpenSea on Mainnet.



**Why can't you see your POAP on Etherscan/OpenSea?**&#x20;

To make POAPs free for collectors, POAPs are minted on the xDai chain, a sidechain of Ethereum. As Etherscan and OpenSea can only show what's on the Ethereum Mainnet, you won't be able to see your POAP collection unless you migrate it to Mainnet (by paying the gas fees).



**How to migrate a POAP to Mainnet?**&#x20;

In order to migrate a POAP from xDai to Mainnet, go to POAP Scan and input your Ethereum address/ENS to see your collection. Once this is done, select the POAP you wish to migrate, click it, and scroll down until you see the "Migrate" button. When you click the “Migrate” button, you will be prompted to confirm the transaction. Keep in mind that you will have to pay gas fees.
