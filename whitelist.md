# Whitelist

**Whitelisting**&#x20;

The term whitelisting comes from the information technology/cybersecurity world and generally means an “allow” or “safe” list, but in the NFT world it means something more specific.

For NFTs, whitelisting is the process of getting a crypto wallet address pre-approved for a future NFT mint.

Since most NFTs are launched on the Ethereum blockchain, the address being whitelisted would be your public Ethereum (ETH) address.



**What does it mean to be whitelisted?**&#x20;

To be whitelisted means that you have gone through the process/steps, as defined by the NFT project team, of getting your ETH address pre-approved to mint an NFT at some predefined date and time.

Usually this date and time for whitelisted addresses is set as a window of time. For example, some projects may allow whitelisted addresses to mint an NFT anytime within a predefined 48-hour period.



**What is whitelisting used for?**&#x20;

Whitelisting is typically used for 2 general purposes:

To reward early supports of an NFT project To prevent a gas war
